# Spark-Streaming-with-twitter-and-kafka

We will create a Spark Streaming application that will continuously read data from
Twitter about a topic. These Twitter feeds will be analyzed for their sentiment, and then analyzed
using ElasticSearch. To exchange data between these two, we used Kafka as a broker.
